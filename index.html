       <p>
       My name is Drew Stroede and I am a software developer based out of 
       Houston, Texas. While based out of Houston, I have had the opportunity to live in the midwest, the east coast and even the west coast. I have a background in college athletics as well as a masters degree in business administration. My professional experiences span from sales, to team building and also optimizing human performance.
       In the tech world, I am passionate about using web development to help people sharpen their own skills, build productive habits, and push themselves to levels they have not previously attained. 
       In my free time, I find the most pride in bringing people together and hosting deep meaningful conversations.

        My goal is to use the latest and greatest technology in the wold of coding to create functional apps that allow people to improve their life, health, and relationships. Currently I am enrolled in classes with Code Fellows to learn and get repetition on the basics of coding while using my free time to dive into a intro python book.
