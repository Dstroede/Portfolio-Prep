    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Drew Stroede and I currently live in Houston, Texas. Before Houston I was living life as a bit of a nomad where I live in Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Tampa Bay.
        Despite living in many different cities, I spent most of my life growing up in the Midwestern state of Wisconsin! 
        Before coming to code fellows, I was a performance coach at Future. A startup tech company that guides you in your fitness journey.
        At future I was a performance coach, which means I met clients and messaged them on a daily basis to create fitness plans for them based on their goals and experience.
        Most of my professional life I have been in a field related to fitness or athletics, even while I was in school to get my MBA.
        While my experiences may not sound useful in the tech world the career has taught me very much about building essential habits, creating goals for yourself, leading people, relationship building and many more!
        I have many goals that I would like to accomplish on a macro scale but in the short term I want to pass this class. I also have a intro book on Python that I would like to finish by the end of this class. Down the line I would also like to position my self to an internship or entry level position in software developement by the end of the year!
