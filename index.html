    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
       <h2>Bio</h2>
        My name is Drew Stroede and I currently live in Houston, Texas. I was born and raised in Wisconsin to a family of 7.  I grew up very active playing lots of athletics, these sports lead me to play college football as I got my bachelors is science with a major in kinesiology.
        Since leaving Wisconsin, I have lived all over the place in cities such as; Tampa Bay, Columbia, Phoenix, and Las Vagas/
        
        <h2>Experience</h2>
        Before coming to code fellows, I was a performance coach at Future, a startup tech company that guides you in your fitness journey.
        At future, I was a performance coach, which means I met clients and messaged them on a daily basis to create fitness plans for them based on their goals and experience.
        Most of my professional life I have been in a field related to fitness or athletics, even while I was in school to get my MBA.
        While my experiences may not sound useful in the tech world, the career has taught me very much about building essential habits, creating goals for yourself, leading people, relationship building and much more!
        
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        I have many goals that I would like to accomplish on a macro scale but for the time being I'm focused on passing this class. I also have a intro book on Python that I would like to finish by the end of this class as well. Lastly, I would like to position myself to be able to take on an internship in software developement by the end of the year!
